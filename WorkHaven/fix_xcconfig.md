# Fix Grok API Key Configuration

## The Problem
The app can't find the Grok API key from the `secrets.xcconfig` file because it's not properly integrated into the Xcode project build settings.

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Add xcconfig to Xcode Project
1. **Open WorkHaven.xcodeproj in Xcode**
2. **Right-click on the WorkHaven project** in the navigator
3. **Select "Add Files to WorkHaven"**
4. **Navigate to and select `WorkHaven/secrets.xcconfig`**
5. **Make sure "Add to target" is checked for WorkHaven**
6. **Click "Add"**

### Step 2: Configure Build Settings
1. **Select the WorkHaven project** in the navigator
2. **Select the WorkHaven target**
3. **Go to "Build Settings" tab**
4. **Search for "Config File" or "Configuration Settings File"**
5. **Set "Configuration Settings File" to `secrets.xcconfig` for both Debug and Release**
6. **Make sure the path is correct: `WorkHaven/secrets.xcconfig`**

### Step 3: Verify Configuration
1. **Build the project** (Cmd+B)
2. **Check the console** for API key status messages
3. **Look for**: `✅ Found Grok API key in xcconfig: xai-nBTAGe...`

### Step 4: Alternative - Add to Info.plist (Quick Fix)
If the xcconfig approach doesn't work immediately, you can add the API key directly to Info.plist:

1. **Open `WorkHaven/Info.plist`**
2. **Add this before the closing `</dict>` tag**:
```xml
<key>GROK_API_KEY</key>
<string>YOUR_GROK_API_KEY_HERE</string>
```

## Troubleshooting

### If xcconfig still doesn't work:
1. **Check the file path** in Build Settings
2. **Make sure the file is added to the project** (not just in the file system)
3. **Clean and rebuild** the project (Product → Clean Build Folder)
4. **Check for typos** in the xcconfig file

### If you see "Available Info.plist keys" in console:
- This means the xcconfig isn't being read
- The keys listed are what's actually available
- Use the Info.plist method as a fallback

## Verification
After fixing, you should see:
- `✅ Found Grok API key in xcconfig: xai-nBTAGe...`
- Auto-discovery should work in Settings
- No more "Grok API key not found" errors
